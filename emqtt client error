I can't complete the emqtt client SDK for emqx.
When I run make I get this error

1 out of 1 hunk FAILED
Skip patching patches/73a11d7bdc724432964a2d4bdc4211ed29823380.patch, already applied
./build.sh: 18: ./build.sh: cmake: not found

I'm installing emqtt on Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)

On the Linux machine I also have Erlang/OTP 25 [erts-13.1.4] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1] [jit:ns]

Could you explain to me what to do to resolve the hunk FAILED error
